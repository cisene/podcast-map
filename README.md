RegEx patterns to match known Podcast Rss-feed link URLs

This is an attempt of matching 90% of all URL formats out there -- to deduce if podcast feed or not.

Feel free to contribute. Feel free to use -- but please reference source.




Updates:

  2021-01-03: Added more patterns, removed ruleset attribute name, renamed ruleset attribute sort to domain

  2020-09-23: Added the companion patterns, to add coverage in podcast feed discovery

  2020-08-27: Lowering the bar, patterns with at least 25 similar links are being added. Optimized some patterns that were too specific to be a little "wider".
